	<p>ICC Chief Executive David Richardson today welcomed the decision of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to stage Indian Premier League (IPL) 2014 matches in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p>

	<p>“The BCCI’s decision to stage the first part of the IPL 2014 season in the UAE is great news for the people of the UAE and the region. It will complete a remarkable season of cricket in the UAE, which has already seen the successful staging of the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier 2013 and the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup 2014.</p>

	<p>“This news comes on the back of the on-field success of the UAE national team which has qualified for both the ICC World Twenty20 2014 in Bangladesh and the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 in Australia and New Zealand and has the potential to propel cricket’s profile to new heights in the country.”</p>

	<p>Mr. Richardson, who is based in the UAE at the ICC headquarters in Dubai Sports City, said the ICC was ready to support the successful staging of the IPL 2014 matches in its home country.</p>

	<p>“Recognising the importance of the integrity of the competition, the ICC will provide its full support for the matches in the UAE, including through the provision of anti-corruption services. It will also be a good opportunity for both the BCCI and the ICC to share knowledge and experience as we both strive to deliver memorable events to cricket fans around the world.”</p>
