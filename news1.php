	<b>MEDIA RELEASE</b>

	<p>The BCCI’s Venue Inspection team, comprising Dr. M.V. Sridhar, GM – Cricket Operations, BCCI, and Mr. P.R. Vishwanathan, Curator, BCCI, visited the venues that will be hosting the UAE leg of the Pepsi IPL 2014, on 21 March 2014 and 22 March 2014.</p>

	<p>The officials accordingly visited the Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah Cricket Stadium, and Dubai International Cricket Stadium. They also visited the ICC Academy at Dubai.</p>

	<p>The primary purpose of the exercise was to assess the ground conditions, status of the pitches, outfield and practice facilities, at the venues. The team also inspected the facilities that are in place for the players, match officials and umpires, including the dressing-rooms and medical arrangements.</p>

	<p>The Venue Inspections were followed by a meeting with the Venue Officials and Curators, at the ICC Academy, on 22 March 2014. The IPL Guidelines and Pitch Requirements were explained and elaborated upon, during this meeting.</p>

	<p>“We are very happy with the facilities at the venues that will be hosting the UAE leg of the Pepsi IPL 2014. The infrastructure is on par with any of the leading international venues. Considering the amount of cricket that has been played at these venues in the recent past, the ground and pitch maintenance is noteworthy. We are confident that the facilities and ground conditions will provide the platform for an exciting first leg of the Pepsi IPL 2014,” Dr. M.V. Sridhar, GM – Cricket Operations, BCCI, said.</p>

	<p>The Venue Inspection Team will be planning the training schedules of all eight teams participating in the Pepsi IPL 2014, in coordination with the venues. All eight sides will be allotted a reasonable number of playing and training schedules at the venues, in the afternoons, as well as evenings (under floodlights).</p>

	<p>The teams are expected to arrive in the UAE in the second week of April 2014.</p>
