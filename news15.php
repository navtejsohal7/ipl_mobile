	<b>MEDIA RELEASE</b>


	<p>The 2014 Pepsi IPL Player Auction will be held on Wednesday, 12 February 2014, and Thursday, 13 February 2014 (if required), at the Mysore Hall, ITC Gardenia, Bengaluru.</p>

	<p>The proceedings will begin at 9:30 am, on 12 February 2014. The auction will be conducted by Richard Madley, a professional auctioneer from England who has conducted each of the previous IPL player auctions. The proceedings will be telecast live on the SONY SIX HD and SONY SIX channels.</p>

	<p>“The start of the Pepsi IPL 2014 is only two months away. Each team has done a lot of brainstorming in the past few months. Old strategies would have been modified, and new ones chalked out. Some players have been retained by their respective franchises, and others returned to the auction pool. It will be fascinating to see each team pit its plans and tactics against the other seven, in what promises to be an eventful auction. We have no doubt that the Player Auction will be as exciting and memorable as the seventh season of the IPL,” Ranjib Biswal, Chairman, IPL, said.</p>
